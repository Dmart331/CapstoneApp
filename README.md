## Rise

Rise was created to combine my three favorite apps into on app. I found myself using weather, news and traffic all before I left the house and each app takes time to boot up. I wanted an easier solution, so I did my best to solve this problem.

## Installation

Simply pull down the project file and replace the google API with your own, as well as the WeatherUnderground API. 

## Usage

Follow the directions on the splash page and enjoy!
